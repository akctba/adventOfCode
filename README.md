# Advent of code challenges 2020
## watta year my friends, watta year...

These are the solutions for the programming puzzles that were part of the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com)

I'm solving using JavaScript and NodeJs.

To run go on the console, go to the root folder and use the command:
- npm start
- type the day od advent (1-25) or something else to exit.

Here are some friends repositories for the same in different programming languages:
